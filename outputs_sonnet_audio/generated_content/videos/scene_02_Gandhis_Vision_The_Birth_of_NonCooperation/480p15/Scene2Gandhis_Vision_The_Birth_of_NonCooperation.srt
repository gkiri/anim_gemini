1
00:00:02,466 --> 00:00:05,715
Mahatma Gandhi emerged as the leader who could

2
00:00:05,815 --> 00:00:09,791
channel this widespread anger into organized resistance.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,717
In 1920, he launched the Non-Cooperation Movement, based

4
00:00:14,817 --> 00:00:19,500
on his philosophy of Satyagraha or non-violent resistance.

5
00:00:19,866 --> 00:00:23,587
Gandhi's strategy was revolutionary yet simple: if Indians

6
00:00:23,687 --> 00:00:27,802
stopped cooperating with British institutions and withdrew their

7
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:31,491
support, the colonial system would collapse from within.

8
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:34,964
He believed that British rule in India survived

9
00:00:35,064 --> 00:00:37,957
only because Indians participated in it - as

10
00:00:38,057 --> 00:00:42,039
government employees, students in British schools, buyers of

11
00:00:42,139 --> 00:00:45,916
British goods, and participants in British legal systems.

12
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:49,603
Gandhi called upon Indians to boycott British goods,

13
00:00:49,703 --> 00:00:53,622
resign from government jobs, withdraw children from government

14
00:00:53,722 --> 00:00:57,058
schools, and refuse to participate in British courts.
