1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,473
Although the Non-Cooperation Movement was called off, its impact

2
00:00:04,573 --> 00:00:08,475
on Indian politics and society was profound and lasting.

3
00:00:08,866 --> 00:00:13,088
For the first time, millions of ordinary Indians had participated

4
00:00:13,188 --> 00:00:17,875
in a coordinated struggle against British rule, transforming the freedom

5
00:00:17,975 --> 00:00:21,266
movement from an elite affair into a mass movement.

6
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:26,856
The movement established Gandhi as the undisputed leader of

7
00:00:26,956 --> 00:00:32,091
Indian nationalism and demonstrated the power of non-violent resistance.

8
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:37,001
It also led to the emergence of new leaders and the

9
00:00:37,101 --> 00:00:41,491
spread of nationalist ideas to villages and towns across India.

10
00:00:42,933 --> 00:00:46,081
The economic boycott of British goods gave a

11
00:00:46,181 --> 00:00:50,658
significant boost to Indian industries, particularly textiles.

12
00:00:52,133 --> 00:00:55,629
Perhaps most importantly, the movement shattered the myth

13
00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:59,036
of British invincibility and showed that colonial rule

14
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:02,758
could be challenged through organized, peaceful resistance.

15
00:01:04,266 --> 00:01:08,585
The strategies and methods developed during this movement

16
00:01:08,685 --> 00:01:12,462
would be refined and used in subsequent struggles,

17
00:01:12,562 --> 00:01:16,416
ultimately leading to India's independence in 1947.
