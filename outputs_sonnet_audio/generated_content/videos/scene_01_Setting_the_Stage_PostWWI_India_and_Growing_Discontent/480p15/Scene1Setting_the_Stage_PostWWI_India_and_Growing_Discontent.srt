00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,475
After World War I ended in 1918, India was seething with discontent.

2
00:00:11,133 --> 00:00:15,166
The British had promised self-governance in return for India's

3
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:19,433
support during the war, but these promises remained unfulfilled.

4
00:00:21,066 --> 00:00:24,248
The economic burden of the war had devastated

5
00:00:24,348 --> 00:00:28,916
India's economy, leading to widespread poverty and unemployment.

6
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:34,008
Adding fuel to the fire were two major incidents: the

7
00:00:34,108 --> 00:00:38,496
Rowlatt Act of 1919, which gave the British government sweeping

8
00:00:38,596 --> 00:00:42,058
powers to arrest and detain Indians without trial,

9
00:00:43,466 --> 00:00:47,462
and the horrific Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar, where

10
00:00:47,562 --> 00:00:51,491
British troops fired on unarmed civilians, killing hundreds.

11
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:57,542
These events shattered Indian faith in British justice and created

12
00:00:57,642 --> 00:01:01,983
the perfect conditions for a mass movement against colonial rule.
