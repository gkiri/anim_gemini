1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,649
By 1922, the movement had gained tremendous

2
00:00:07,749 --> 00:00:11,050
momentum, but it faced a critical test.

3
00:00:11,666 --> 00:00:16,062
On February 5, 1922, in the small town of Chauri Chaura

4
00:00:16,162 --> 00:00:20,966
in Uttar Pradesh, a group of protesters clashed with police.

5
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:25,655
When the police opened fire, the angry crowd retaliated by

6
00:00:25,755 --> 00:00:30,166
setting fire to the police station, killing 22 policemen inside.

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,810
This incident of violence deeply troubled Gandhi, who believed

8
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,325
that the movement had lost its non-violent character.

9
00:00:40,533 --> 00:00:45,447
Despite strong opposition from other leaders like Motilal Nehru and C.R. Das,

10
00:00:45,547 --> 00:00:49,615
who argued that the movement was on the verge of success, Gandhi

11
00:00:49,715 --> 00:00:53,783
made the controversial decision to call off the entire movement.

12
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,000
He believed that a movement based on violence, even if successful,

13
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,750
would not lead to the kind of free India he envisioned.
