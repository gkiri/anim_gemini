# Visual Script (LLM-Generated Manim Code) for: Scene 1: Topic - Non-Cooperation Movement

## Prompt Sent to LLM:

```text

        You are an expert Manim programmer. Your task is to generate a complete, runnable Manim Python script for a single scene.
        The script should define a Manim Scene class named 'Scene1Scene_1_Topic__NonCooperation_Movement'.
        This class should inherit from `manim.Scene`.

        Topic of the video: "Non-Cooperation Movement"
        Title of this specific scene: "Scene 1: Topic - Non-Cooperation Movement"
        Narration/Key Points for this scene:
        '''This is the narration for scene 1 concerning Non-Cooperation Movement. More details would be generated by an AI.'''

        Instructions for Manim code generation:
        1.  Create a class `Scene1Scene_1_Topic__NonCooperation_Movement(Scene)`.
        2.  Implement the `construct(self)` method.
        3.  Use Manim objects (Text, Tex, MathTex, Shapes like Circle, Square, Polygon, Line, etc.) to visually represent the narration and scene title. Prefer Manim's built-in vector objects.
        4.  Be highly creative and ensure the animation is visually rich, engaging, and helps explain the topic clearly for a UPSC (Indian Civil Services Exam) student.
        5.  Make sure text is readable, not too small, and does not overflow the screen.
        6.  Animations should be smooth. Use effects like FadeIn, FadeOut, Write, Create, Transform, LaggedStart, etc.
        7.  Ensure all elements are properly positioned and do not overlap unintentionally.
        8.  The animation for this scene should be self-contained within the `Scene1Scene_1_Topic__NonCooperation_Movement` class.
        9.  The script MUST include all necessary imports (e.g., `from manim import *`).
        10. The generated code should be a single Python script block, ready to be saved and run.
        11. Do NOT include any explanations or text outside the Python code block itself.
        12. **Critical for avoiding errors:** Do NOT use `SVGMobject` or `ImageMobject` with placeholder file paths (e.g., 'path/to/icon.svg', 'image.png', 'your_image.jpg'). These will cause the script to fail.
        13. Instead of external files, represent all visual elements using Manim's built-in shapes (`Circle`, `Square`, `Triangle`, `Line`, `Polygon`, etc.), `Text`, `Tex`, or `MathTex`. For example, to represent an idea, you might use a `Lightbulb` shape if available, or compose it from a `Circle` and `Lines`. If you want to suggest where a specific image *could* ideally be used (if the user had it), add a comment like `# An icon of [concept] could be placed here` but ensure the *functional code* uses Manim shapes as a fallback or primary representation (e.g., `placeholder_icon = Circle(radius=0.5)`).
        14. Strive for production-quality, error-free Manim code.
        15. Consider using a variety of Manim objects and animations to make the scene dynamic.
        16. If the narration mentions specific entities, people, or concepts, try to represent them visually using Manim's shape and text objects. For example, represent a person abstractly with a combination of simple shapes.
        17. Pay attention to timing and pacing. A typical scene might be 15-30 seconds long.

        Example of structure:
        ```python
        from manim import *

        class Scene1Scene_1_Topic__NonCooperation_Movement(Scene):
            def construct(self):
                # Your animation code here
                title_text = Text("Scene 1: Topic - Non-Cooperation Movement").to_edge(UP)
                self.play(Write(title_text))
                # ... more animations based on narration ...
                self.wait(2)
        ```
        
        Now, generate the Manim Python code for scene 'Scene 1: Topic - Non-Cooperation Movement'.
        
```
