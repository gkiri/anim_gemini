            "title": "Seeds of Discontent",
            "narration": "After World War I, Indians expected political reforms from Britain. Instead, the Rowlatt Act continued repressive measures. Then came the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 1919 \u2013 British troops fired on unarmed civilians. This brutality ignited nationwide outrage. Mahatma Gandhi, advocating non-violent resistance, saw a nation ready for change. He proposed a radical idea: withdraw cooperation from British institutions to expose their moral bankruptcy and paralyze their rule."

            "scene_number": 2,
            "title": "The Call to Action",
            "narration": "In 1920, Gandhi formally launched the Non-Cooperation Movement. Millions answered his call. Students left government schools, lawyers quit British courts, and citizens resigned from official positions. People boycotted British goods \u2013 foreign cloth was burned in bonfires, replaced by homespun khadi. Elections were shunned, and titles bestowed by the British were surrendered. The movement transformed from elite circles to a mass uprising, uniting peasants, workers, and students across India."

            "title": "Building Parallel Systems",
            "narration": "Withdrawal wasn't just protest \u2013 it was construction. Indians built alternative systems. National schools and colleges opened, teaching pride in Indian culture. Panchayats (local councils) resolved disputes instead of British courts. People's committees managed community affairs. Hand-spinning became a symbol of self-reliance, with charkhas humming in villages. This parallel governance weakened British authority and empowered communities, showing India could function independently."

            "title": "Chauri Chaura and Suspension",
            "narration": "In February 1922, the movement faced a crisis. Protesters clashed with police in Chauri Chaura, Uttar Pradesh. A police station was set ablaze, killing 22 officers. Gandhi, horrified by the violence, suspended the movement immediately. He argued that non-violence was sacrosanct \u2013 any compromise would corrupt the struggle. While many supporters were dismayed, Gandhi fasted to atone and redirected efforts towards social reform like eradicating untouchability."

            "scene_number": 5,
            "title": "Legacy of Defiance",
            "narration": "Though suspended, the movement reshaped India's freedom struggle. It demonstrated the power of mass non-violent resistance, bringing millions into politics for the first time. British prestige and economy suffered as Indians reclaimed agency. It proved Gandhi's methods could challenge an empire, inspiring future campaigns. Most importantly, it forged a unified national identity, transforming the demand for reform into an unstoppable cry for complete independence."
