            "title": "The Spark of Discontent",
            "narration": "Post-World War I, India seethed with frustration. Despite sacrifices made by Indian soldiers for Britain, the Rowlatt Act allowed indefinite detention without trial. The horrific Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 1919, where British troops fired on unarmed civilians, became the final straw. This scene shows Indian leaders and citizens grappling with broken promises, setting the stage for a powerful response."

            "scene_number": 2,
            "title": "Gandhi's Call to Action",
            "narration": "Enter Mahatma Gandhi, advocating non-violent resistance. In 1920, he launches the Non-Cooperation Movement with a clear strategy: withdraw support from British institutions. We see Gandhi passionately urging Indians to boycott British schools, courts, and goods. The spinning wheel emerges as a symbol of self-reliance, while thousands return medals and titles in a collective rejection of colonial authority."

            "scene_number": 3,
            "title": "Nationwide Mobilization",
            "narration": "The movement ignites like wildfire across India. Students abandon classrooms, lawyers quit courts, and workers go on strike. Villagers boycott foreign cloth, lighting bonfires of imported textiles. Hindu-Muslim unity strengthens as people march together. This scene depicts mass rallies, homemade khadi production, and the emergence of local leadership \u2013 showing how ordinary citizens paralyzed the colonial machinery through peaceful non-participation."
        },
        {
            "scene_number": 4,
            "title": "The Chauri Chaura Turning Point",
            "narration": "In February 1922, violence erupts in Chauri Chaura when protesters clash with police, leading to deaths. Devastated by this breach of non-violence, Gandhi makes the controversial decision to suspend the movement. This scene dramatizes the tragedy, Gandhi's moral dilemma, and the fractured public reaction \u2013 from disillusionment to renewed determination among freedom fighters."
        },
        {
            "scene_number": 5,
            "title": "Enduring Legacy",
            "narration": "Though suspended, the movement transformed India's freedom struggle. It demonstrated the power of mass mobilization and made independence an attainable goal. Colonial revenues plummeted while national pride soared. We see how it paved the way for future movements, inspired global civil rights leaders, and proved that non-violent resistance could shake an empire. Final shots show the tricolor flag rising as Gandhi's spinning wheel keeps turning."
