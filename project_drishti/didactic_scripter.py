Description:
This module is responsible for taking a UPSC (or other educational) topic
and breaking it down into a structured, didactic script. The script is
divided into logical scenes, each with a title and narration.
This forms the foundational content for the subsequent visual and animation stages.

Key functionalities:
1.  Receives a topic string.
2.  (Future) Potentially fetches and verifies information related to the topic.
3.  Structures the information into a predefined number of scenes (e.g., 4-10).
4.  Generates a title and narration for each scene.
5.  Outputs the script in a structured format (e.g., JSON).
