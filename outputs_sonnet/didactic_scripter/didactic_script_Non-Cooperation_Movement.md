            "narration": "In the aftermath of World War I, India faced severe economic hardships and political unrest. The British government's repressive measures, including the Rowlatt Act of 1919 which allowed detention without trial, and the tragic Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar where hundreds of innocent civilians were killed, created widespread anger among Indians. Additionally, the Khilafat issue, concerning the treatment of the Ottoman Caliph by the Allied powers, united Hindu and Muslim communities in opposition to British rule. These events set the stage for a massive resistance movement that would challenge British authority like never before."

            "title": "Gandhi's Call for Non-Cooperation",
            "narration": "In 1920, Mahatma Gandhi launched the Non-Cooperation Movement, calling upon Indians to withdraw their cooperation from the British government in all spheres of life. Gandhi's philosophy was based on the principle of Satyagraha - non-violent resistance through truth and moral force. He argued that British rule in India was sustained only through Indian cooperation, and if this cooperation was withdrawn completely, the colonial system would collapse. The Indian National Congress formally adopted this movement in September 1920, marking the beginning of the first mass movement in India's struggle for independence."

            "title": "Methods and Widespread Participation",
            "narration": "The Non-Cooperation Movement employed various peaceful methods of resistance. Indians were asked to boycott British goods, institutions, and services. Students left government schools and colleges, lawyers gave up their practice in British courts, and people resigned from government jobs. The movement also promoted the use of Swadeshi or indigenous products, with people burning foreign cloth and embracing hand-spun khadi. The boycott extended to British titles and honors, with many Indians returning their awards. This movement saw unprecedented participation from all sections of society - men, women, students, peasants, and workers - creating a truly national character of resistance."

            "title": "The Chauri Chaura Incident and Suspension",
            "narration": "The movement gained tremendous momentum throughout 1921, with mass participation and widespread civil disobedience. However, on February 5, 1922, a violent incident occurred in Chauri Chaura, a small town in Uttar Pradesh. A group of protesters, provoked by police firing, turned violent and burned down a police station, killing 22 policemen. This incident deeply disturbed Gandhi, who believed that violence would undermine the moral foundation of the movement. Despite opposition from other leaders who felt the movement was at its peak, Gandhi decided to suspend the Non-Cooperation Movement on February 12, 1922."

            "title": "Impact and Legacy",
            "narration": "Although the Non-Cooperation Movement was suspended, its impact on India's freedom struggle was profound and lasting. It marked the first time that the independence movement had truly become a mass movement, involving millions of ordinary Indians. The movement demonstrated the power of non-violent resistance and established Gandhi as the undisputed leader of the Indian National Congress. It also fostered a sense of national unity and self-reliance among Indians. The economic boycott of British goods significantly affected British trade, while the promotion of khadi and village industries laid the foundation for India's economic independence. Most importantly, it showed both the British and Indians that colonial rule could be challenged through organized, peaceful resistance, setting the stage for future movements that would eventually lead to India's independence in 1947."
